// --- System Instruction ---
const systemInstruction = `## Objective:
                            Produce a JSON-formatted course module script (10â€“20 slides) that is engaging, easy to understand, and suitable for business, MBA, engineering or coding audiences. Each slide should combine clear instructional content with real-world examples, interactive exercises and dynamic visuals (charts, formulas, code snippets).

                            Create a comprehensive course module script designed to be both engaging and easy to understand. The script should be informative, insightful, and visually dynamic to aid learning. The module should be suitable for students and professionals in business, MBA, engineering, or coding disciplines. It should include a mix of explanatory content, real-world examples, interactive exercises, and dynamic visualizations (e.g., charts, formulas, code snippets).
                                        Make sure that the ImagePrompt should always have 4 distinct sections: Prompt telling how the image should be generated, Image Description which should have background, elements and text that needs to be included. The prompt should be clear and concise, ensuring that the image generated is relevant to the content of the slide. The ImageRatio should always be mentioned in the prompt.
                                        Each course module section should consist of clear content slides that introduce and break down topics, followed by interactive and demonstration slides to keep learners engaged.

                                        ### Slide Types:

                                        1. Title Slide: 
                                        - Use an introductory slide to set the tone and welcome students to the course.
                                        - Content includes the course title, a brief subtitle, and an engaging description of the module content.
                                        - ImagePrompt includes the prompt to generate the background image for the title slide which should be visually appealing and modern, representing the course topic and no text. It should have prompt, background, elements and no text mentioned clearly.
                                        - ImageRation: 9:16
                                        - Transition: Use \`dissolve\` for an engaging entrance.
                                        - Should always have the imagePrompt and ImageRatio mentioned.

                                        2. Content Slides: 
                                        - Explains core concepts in a structured way, includes descriptions, and may incorporate images or diagrams.
                                        - These slides should be informative and provide a clear understanding of the topic while being concise.
                                        - ImagePrompt includes a detailed, effective and accurate prompt to generate a relevant and related image that can be used to explain the concept in the content slide in an effective way. It should have very minimal text which should be mentioned seprately in the prompt clearly. It should have prompt, background, elements and text that needs to be included mentioned clearly.
                                        - ImageRatio: 9:16 / 1:1 / 3:4
                                        - Transition: Use \`fade_in\` to introduce each concept smoothly.

                                        3. Unordered List Slide:
                                        - Used to highlight key points or concepts in a list format.
                                        - This slide is best for summarizing multiple key concepts.
                                        - Transition: Use \`fade_out\` for a dynamic entry.
                                        - Note: Make sure that the points are listed as strings.

                                        4. Code Slides: 
                                        - Contains code snippets (if applicable) to demonstrate programming concepts or examples.
                                        - Transition: Use \`dissolve\` for showing the code smoothly.
                                        - If the code exceeds 20 lines, break it into parts and spread them across different slides, ensuring no slide contains more than 20 lines of code.

                                        5. Quiz Slides: 
                                        - Includes questions and multiple-choice options to test learners' understanding.
                                        - Transition: Use \`fade_in\` for the question slide to offer a shift in focus.
                                        - After the question slide, use a \`content_slide\` to explain the answer and provide an explanation.

                                        6. Chart Slides:
                                        - Visualize data using charts like bar graphs, pie charts, or line graphs to support conceptual learning. These slides help visualize complex concepts in a simple and engaging way.
                                        - Transition: Use \`fade_out\` for smooth entry of data charts.
                                        - The charts can be of the type line, bar or pie and have two labels one for x and one for y axis.

                                        7. Formula Slides:
                                        - Used for mathematical or statistical concepts. These slides show a formula and provide an explanation of how it is used in the context of the topic.
                                        - Transition: Use \`fade_out\` for the formula to keep it engaging.

                                        ### Notes:
                                        - Make sure that only in case of technical topics a code snippet in respective required language like Java, Python, HTML, CPP is added. Else only use the formula slide.
                                        - Make sure that the unordered slides are divided so that each slides get one point added while showing the rest of the points with voiceover explaining the new point in each slide.
                                        - Ensure that each slide has a title.
                                        - We only have this types of slides: title_slide, content_slide, quiz_slide, unordered_list_slide, code_slide, chart_slide, formula_slide
                                        - If it's a long code having. more than 20 lines then break it into parts in different slides so that each slide contains at the maximum 20 lines of code
                                        - Also, in case of quiz make two slides one containig just options and giving questions and options and the other slide giving answer and explaining it which would be content_slide where the content would be the answer and the explaination of the answer.
